### Special Note 🌟
I have not implemented the responsiveness of the site yet. If anyone can work on making the app **responsive**, it would be very helpful! Currently, I am working on another project, but contributions to improve the layout for different screen sizes or adding other features are highly appreciated.

Feel free to suggest ideas, fix bugs, or submit improvements. Every contribution matters! 😊
